This repository contains my collection of the implimentation various Data structures and algorithms along with some questions which i think are really important to understand the concepts of the above said topics.

### Data Structures
1.  Arrays
2.  Linked Lists - Singly Linked, Doubly linked list, Circular linked list, circular doubly linked list
3.  Stacks and Queues
4.  Trees and Binary Trees
5.  Graphs
6.  Hash Tables
7.  Heaps
8.  Trie
9.  Segment Trees
10.  Disjoint Sets
11.  Balanced Binary Search Trees
12.  Priority Queues
13.  AVL Trees and Red-Black Trees

###### Types of tree (based on my present knowledge)
